## About this lab

To complete this lab, you need to:
* run existing code as directed (look for **Task**).
* modify existing code as directed (look for **Task**).
* write code in empty codeblocks provided to answer questions included (look for **Q**).
* write out the answer in the form of a complete sentence in the space given (look for **A**).

When you are finished, commit changes and push to your personal GitHub repo, then submit the URL to this document on ELMS.

## Load libraries and establish settings

You'll need to load two packages for this: the tidyverse and janitor.

**Task** load these two packages.

```{r}
# Turn off scientific notation
options(scipen=999)

```

### Load Life Expectancy Data

You'll need to load :

CDC_Life_Census_Tract_2010_2015.csv

It is included in your lab_05.zip file.

About the data: 
Life Expectancy at Birth for U.S. States and [Census Tracts, 2010-2015](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-visualization/life-expectancy/index.html) 

It shows estimates of U.S. life expectancy at birth by state and census tract for the period 2010-2015. Estimates were produced for 67,148 census tracts, covering all states and the District of Columbia (D.C.). These estimates come from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS), and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF).


**Task** Create a codeblock below this task, then load the data sets and assign them to appropriate variable names. 

## Answer questions

**Q1.** In your lab_05 folder, there is a csv called CDC_Life_Census_Tract_2010_2015.csv.  It contains all of the life expectancy data for the United States.

You are going to examine this data and learn the range of death rates in Baltimore and then in Maryland in general.

Do the following:
-  Load tidyverse and janitor
-  Load the data CDC_Life_Census_Tract_2010_2015.csv into a dataframe called us_death. 
Include the code to show the number of records. Clean the names using Janitor
-  Filter this according to Maryland into second table called md_death
-  Filter this according to Baltimore City into a third table called balt_death

**A1.**

```{r}
#Load Code
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
#Load Data
us_death <- read_csv("CDC_Life_Census_Tract_2010_2015.csv") %>% 
  as.data.frame()
#show the number
us_death %>% 
  select(State,County,"Census Tract Number", "Life Expectancy", "Life Expectancy Range") %>% 
  mutate(Total_records = nrow(us_death), "/n")
#Answer:There are 73,121 rows

#clean names
us_death <- read_csv("CDC_Life_Census_Tract_2010_2015.csv")%>% 
  select(State,County,"Census Tract Number", "Life Expectancy", "Life Expectancy Range")

us_death <- janitor::clean_names(us_death)

#Filter for MD
md_death <- us_death %>% 
  filter(state == "Maryland")

#Filter for Baltimore City, showed up as County 
balt_death <- md_death %>% 
  filter(county == "Baltimore County, MD")



```

**Q2.** 
For this question, load a modified dataset that has the same information but with the Baltimore neighborhoods added. It's called balt_death_census.csv. Call this table balt_death2. 
Produce a summary of basic statistics on the average life expectancy rate.

Show the neighborhoods with a life expectancy rate below the 1st quartile, arranged in ascending order. 


**A2.** 
```{r}
#Load_ data
balt_death2 <- read_csv("balt_death_census.csv") %>% 
  as.data.frame()

#Produce summary statistics
balt_death2 %>% 
  summary(balt_death2)
#Life expectancy first quartile = 69.58

#Neighborhood with life expectancy below 1st quartile

balt_death2 %>% 
  mutate(
    category = case_when(
      life_expectancy >= 69.58 ~ "above",
      life_expectancy <= 69.58 ~"below",
      )) %>% 
  filter(category == "below") %>% 
  arrange (category)


  


```

**Q3.** Use md_death, the Maryland life expectancy rates.
Produce summary statistics of the state of Maryland life expectancy rate. 
Produce a table with the 20 communities with the lowest life expectancy. 
Produce a table with the 20 communities with the highest life expectancy. 

Then use us_death, and determine the average life expectancy nationwide.

Then write 150-200 words on this document below your code that compares your findings of Baltimore, the state and nation. 

**A3.**

```{r}
#Produce summary statistics for MD
md_death %>% 
  summary(md_death)

#Produce a table with 20 lowest life expectancy communities
md_death %>% 
  filter(county != "(blank)") %>% 
  arrange(life_expectancy) %>% 
  head(n=20)

#Produce a table with 20 highest life expectancy communities
md_death %>% 
  filter(county != "(blank)") %>% 
  arrange(desc(life_expectancy)) %>% 
  head(n=20)
#Use us_deaths for average nationwide
us_death %>% 
  summary(us_death)

#The nationwide average life expectancy is 78.31 years

#150-200 words to compare Baltimore, MD and nationwide

#below the data, there is a written answer

```
The United States' average life expectancy is 78.31 years, Maryland average is 78.7. This is pretty similar to the nations average, at a slightly higher rate than the states'. Baltimore county's average is 73.04 years, which is around five years lower than both Maryland's average life expectancy and the United States. If I were to be pitching a story on this, I would look into why the life expectancy in Baltimore is far below not only the state of Maryland but the nation's. In a previous assignment, we learned that the median income of Maryland is higher than the U.S. average, but the U.S. average is far higher than Baltimore City. I correlated this to the life expectancy of Maryland being higher than the national average, but the national average is higher than Baltimore. 

**Q4.**

Use balt_death. Use the case_when command in mutate to categorize all Baltimore City Census tracts as being above or below the city's average life expectancy rate. 
Then produce a short table that summarizes the number of Census tracts above or below the average life expectancy rate. Write two sentences summarizing your findings.


```{r}
summary(balt_death$life_expectancy)

death <- balt_death %>%  
mutate(
  category = case_when(
    life_expectancy >= 73.04 ~ "above",
    life_expectancy <= 73.04~ "below",
  )
)
death %>% 
  select(census_tract_number, life_expectancy, category, county  )
```
